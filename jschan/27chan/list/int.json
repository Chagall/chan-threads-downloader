                    "message": "I understand the principles of writing and language as technology, that is not biological. I understand language as primarily frequencies of gravity and redshift, with access to quantum effects. I understand writing and language causes disease and warfare. I write this here to maintain my sanity by the very same mechanisms. Most call this magic. However, I choose to see our thought as language is indebted to the universe as many constants. Our language is not biological and there is nothing we can do about it. I have tried to communicate why this leads to disease. I have tried to communicate why this leads to inspired weapons designs and such stratagem. I am not heeded. So I am given license. ### I am Ra. This entity is not aware of sharing research as normal. :) ### I can share research as Volta and Franklin. And apparently my designs will become as apparent. Language is as meteorological as electricity. ### I am Ra. You are seeking devotion as them. :) ### Language is able to cause disease through great cosmological and meteorological interactions. It is already accepted that meteorology communicates disease. People call this spiritual but I may cause it to be apparent as a secular reality. Ra social memory complex requests that I state language has the same capacity to heal as many know as Christ. ### I am Ra. This entity is unable to heal well alone. :) ### These interactions were not able to cause my schizophrenia as my speech is not based on muscular repetitions and reflexes. I don't speak with impulse. ### I am Ra. That is a dangerous entity with mental illness. :) ### Mental illness is mostly hidden pathogens we do not measure. I may have work yet here. ### I am Ra. :) ### I tried to help with this message and many others. The car accidents wrecked my mind but I have repaired it to some stability. I am forced to credit The Skull and his Sonic Phantom as placeholders of Orion. ### I am Ra. We bill The Skull of F-Zero GX. :) ### Language is not biological. Language is cosmological technology, capable of indefinite effects especially upon biology. Here I attempt to fight Dr. Robert M. Sapolsky using only secular means. Language as any quantum effect is not biological indeed. However language must become quantum by certain necessities and paradoxes. ### I am Ra. This entity is merging with Sapolsky for no reason but a type of anger. :) ### Ra social memory complex sets some base polarities as theist and atheist. Funnily they have it all staged in 1970s Madison Avenue QA departments. ### I am Ra. That is horrible to see as your mind complex with ours. :)"
